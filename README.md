# WebServer_Hive
Webserv is a fully functional, standards-compliant HTTP server implemented from scratch as part of the 42 curriculum. The goal of the project is to deepen understanding of network programming, event-driven architectures, HTTP protocol behavior, configuration parsing, and robust server design, without relying on high-level web server libraries.
